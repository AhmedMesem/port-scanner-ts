# port-scanner-ts
The code defines a function called isPortOpen that takes a port number as an argument and returns a promise that resolves to a boolean value indicating whether the port is open or not on the local machine. The function uses the net module to create a socket connection to the port and listens for the connect or error events. The code also defines an object called services that maps some common port numbers to their corresponding service names. The code then defines another function called scanPorts that loops through all possible port numbers from 1 to 65535 and calls the isPortOpen function for each one using the await keyword. If the port is open, the function prints out the port number and its service name (or “unknown” if not found in the services object) to the console. Finally, the code calls the scanPorts function to start scanning all ports on the local machine.
